\section{Question 4}

\subsection{Part a)}

Let $X$ be the random variable for the number of people who completed the self-sampling for cervical cnacer screening from the direct mail outreach.
Let $Y$ be the random variable for the number of people who compelted screening after the education only outreach.

Therefore $\hat{x} = \frac{505}{1415} \approx 0.3569$ and $\hat{y} = \frac{264}{1408} \approx 0.1875$ which are the sample proportions for $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
