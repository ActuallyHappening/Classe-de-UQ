\section{Question 4}

\subsection{Part a)}
Let $X$ be the random variable for the number of people received the direct mail strategy and compelted screening.
Let $Y$ be the random variable for the number of people who received the education only outreach and completed screening.

The notation $p_\X$ and $p_\Y$ represent the population proportion for $\X$ and $\Y$ respectively.

The null hypothesis is that both population proportions are equal: $\text{H}_0: p_\X = p_\Y = p$. The alternative hypothesis is therefore: $\text{H}_1 : p_\X > p_\Y$.

\subsection{Part b)}

$\X \sim \BinDist (n_\X, p_\X)$ where $n_\X = 1415$ so $\X \sim \BinDist (1415, p_\X)$.
It is (implicitely) assumed that samples $\X_i$ from $\X$ follow the distribution of $\X$, hence:
\[
\X_i \sim \BinDist(n_\X, p_\X)
\]
Since $n_\X p_\X = 505 \gg 5$ and $n_\X(1-p_\X)=910 \gg 5$, the conditions for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to apply are met, as well as a suitably large $n_\X$.
Therefore:
\[
\X_i \mathop \sim ^\text{approx} \NormalDist (n_\X p_\X, n_\X p_\X (1 - p_\X))
\]
\[
\bar{\X} \mathop \sim ^\text{approx} \NormalDist (p_\X, \frac{p_\X (1 - p_\X)}{n_\X})
\]

Under $\text{H}_0$:
\[
\bar{\X} \sim \NormalDist (p, \frac{p (1 - p)}{n_\X})
\]


$\Y \sim \BinDist (n_\Y, p_\Y)$ where $n_\Y = 1408$ so $\Y \sim \BinDist (1408, p_\Y)$.
It is (implicitely) assumed that samples $\Y_i$ from $\Y$ follow the distribution of $\Y$, hence:
\[
\Y_i \sim \BinDist(n_\Y, p_\Y)
\]
Since $n_\Y p_\Y = 264 \gg 5$ and $n_\Y(1-p_\Y)=1144 \gg 5$, the conditions for the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) to apply are met, as well as a suitably large $n_\Y$.
Therefore:
\[
\Y_i \mathop \sim ^\text{approx} \NormalDist (n_\Y p_\Y, n_\Y p_\Y (1 - p_\Y))
\]
\[
\bar{\Y} \mathop \sim ^\text{approx} \NormalDist (p_\Y, \frac{p_\Y (1 - p_\Y)}{n_\Y})
\]

Under $\text{H}_0$:
\[
\bar{\Y} \sim \NormalDist (p, \frac{p (1 - p)}{n_\Y})
\]

% Therefore $\hat{x} = \frac{505}{1415} \approx 0.3569$ and $\hat{y} = \frac{264}{1408} \approx 0.1875$ which are the sample proportions for $X$ and $Y$ respectively.
